## Data Sources

The analysis utilized the following databases and sources:

- **EPD (Eukaryotic Promoter Database):**
  - **Description:** A curated collection of eukaryotic promoter gene sequences, compiled from scientific literature and public databases.
  - **URL:** [EPD](https://epd.expasy.org/epd/)

- **DiproDB:**
  - **Description:** A database of physical parameters for dinucleotides, including values for parameters such as Roll and Slide, as well as the stiffness of these parameters.
  - **URL:** [DiproDB](https://diprodb.fli-leibniz.de/)
  - **Parameter Sources:**
    - Roll, Slide: Petez.
    - Roll stiffness, Slide stiffness: Goni.
    - Mobility to bend towards major groove: Gartenberg.
    - Stacking energy: The source provides stacking energy values for various dinucleotides.

- **Study on Ultrasonic Cleavage for Di- and Tetranucleotides:**
  - **Description:** The article provides data on ultrasonic cleavage, used to analyze the impact on the structural properties of sequences.
  - **URL:** [Biophysical Journal Article](https://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(10)01440-2#app2)

- **Study on DNase Cleavage:**
  - **Description:** This article provides data on DNA cleavage by DNases, which is essential for understanding molecular interactions and DNA structure.
  - **URL:** [PNAS Article](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1216822110#supplementary-materials)


These datasets were used to explore and compare the physicochemical properties of regulatory genomic sequences, including their susceptibility to ultrasonic cleavage and effects on DNA structure. Each data source was integrated to conduct a comprehensive analysis, including visualization and statistical processing of results.
